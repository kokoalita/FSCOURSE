To start the app
    npm run dev -- --host

To start json serve
    npx json-server --port 3001 --watch db.json

To start an .js file 
node [name].js

To install nodemon by defining it as a development dependency with the command:
npm install --save-dev nodemon

To start with no demo node_modules/ .bin/nodemon index.js

TO build de vite app  'npm run buld' --> next save this dis in the root server

Interesting data
    These development dependencies are not needed when the application is run in production mode on the production server (e.g. Fly.io or Heroku).

React
    Componets allways start with capitalized characters.

    React components need a root element like <div>
    or maybe use an array of elements 
    const App = () => {
    return [
        <h1>Greetings</h1>,
        <Hello name='Maya' age={26 + 10} />,
        <Footer />
    ]
    }
    or fragments, enclosed between <> .... </>


Javascript
    iife


    In javascript its important to use de quote "use strict" to prevent the use of global vars
    its important to only use let and constant

    push add to the array
    .concate create a new aray with adding 

    To print errors its importat not to use + like Java
    console.log('props value is', props)

    In java its better to use === instead of == for comparasions because ts safely
