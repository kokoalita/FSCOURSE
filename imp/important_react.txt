React
    Componets allways start with capitalized characters.

    React components need a root element like <div>
    or maybe use an array of elements 
    const App = () => {
    return [
        <h1>Greetings</h1>,
        <Hello name='Maya' age={26 + 10} />,
        <Footer />
    ]
    }
    or fragments, enclosed between <> .... </>


Javascript
    iife


    In javascript its important to use de quote "use strict" to prevent the use of global vars
    its important to only use let and constant

    push add to the array
    .concate create a new aray with adding 

    To print errors its importat not to use + like Java
    console.log('props value is', props)

    In java its better to use === instead of == for comparasions because ts safely
